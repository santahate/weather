# Create Jira Task

## Purpose

- To create a well-defined task in **MCP Jira** for work that is not a bug.
- This includes user-requested features, technical debt, required investigations by the dev team, or other non-defect work items that arise from user interactions.

Remember as you follow the upcoming instructions:

- Clarity is key. The development team needs to understand the "what" and "why" of the task.
- A well-defined task with clear goals and acceptance criteria is more likely to be prioritized and completed correctly.

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Task Context

- Ask the user to describe the required task. You must gather the following information:
    - **Summary/Title:** What is the short summary of the task?
    - **Description/Goal:** Why is this task needed? What is the business value or user benefit? What problem does it solve?
    - **Requirements / Acceptance Criteria:** What needs to be done to consider this task complete? This can be a list of functional requirements or a description of the desired end state.

### 2. Draft the Jira Ticket

- Inform the user you will now draft the content for the Jira task ticket. Structure the content logically:
    - **Title**
    - **Description:** Clearly explain the background, the goal, and the value proposition (the "why").
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** A clear, bulleted list of conditions that must be met for the task to be considered "done".
    - **Attachments / Relevant Info:** A section for any supporting links, documents, or context.

### 3. Confirm and Create

- Present the drafted ticket content to the user for review and approval. Ask if the goal and acceptance criteria are correctly captured.
- Once the user approves, state that you are creating the task in **MCP Jira**.

### 4. Provide Ticket ID and Handoff

- After creating the ticket, provide the user with the **Jira Ticket ID and a direct link**.
- Confirm that the request has been logged and is available for the Product Owner or team to review and prioritize.
